Common UI patterns
------------------

I needed an open-source library for things like cross-browser placeholders, email token fields, etc. So I wrote one. Requires small parts of jQuery UI (widget.js, position.js).

Planned features:

- cross-browser placeholders
- email token fields (*Ã  la* Mail.app)

Cross-Browser Placeholders
--------------------------
I've implemented this sort of thing before, but this is a new take on it. In hopes of being more reliable, we're using jQuery UI to make sure they stay where they're intended. Running into some Safari bugs with padding on input fields, but they should have minimal effect.

Email Token Fields
------------------
Half-done, coming soon.
